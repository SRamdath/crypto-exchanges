This application allows a user to query trades from a particular cryptocurrency exchange platform. 

The user can search through multiple cryptocurrency exchanges to find their desired exchange.

The user can then query the desired exchange based on the cryptocurrency (Base), the currency traded to (Quote), a time interval, and a limit to the returned results.

The trades are represented on a graph showing the amount of the Base currency that was bought or sold to the Quote in intervals of seconds.

This application can be used to visualize trends and patterns to allow the user to potentially predict market changes.
